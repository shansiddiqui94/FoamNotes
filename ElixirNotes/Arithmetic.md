# Arithmetic

<!--
 What are integers and floats?
    *  Integers are whole numbers, including negative numbers.
    * Floats or Floating-point numbers
      * Used to repersent decimal numbers like 
        * 1.22
        * 1.0
What are arithmetic operators?
    * Arithmetic operators are 
      * Add +
      * Subtract - 
      * Multiply * 
      * Divide / 
    * Two special arithmetic operators are
      * div/2 for integer division
      * rem/2 for remainder 

What is the order of operations, and how can you alter it using round brackets ()?
    * Elixir follows the BEDMAS order of Operations aka
      * Brackets
      * Exponents
      * Division
      * Multiplication
      * Addition
      * Subtraction
    * Brackets can be used to override the order of operations in your program
    * It give brackets first priority 
      * (5 + 5) * 2
        * (10) * 2
        * 20

Exponents operators
    * The Exponents operator in Elixir is `**`
        * 10 ** 2 is the same as 10 to the power of 2 or 10 * 10

Remainder
    * In programming we can use remainders to check if a number is evenly divisible by a number.
      * Ex: rem(5, 2)
