<!-- We can use the IO module for retrieving user input and displaying output.

We can use IO.inspect/2 and IO.puts/2 print displaying information.

We can also use IO.gets/2 to retrieve input from the user.

iex> input = IO.gets("Give me some input: ")
Give me some input: sure!
"sure!\n"
iex> input
"sure!\n"
