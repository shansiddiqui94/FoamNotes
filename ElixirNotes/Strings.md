How do we add two strings together using string concatenation?
    * The "<>" operator allows us to join two string together
      * This is called concatenation
      * Only strings can be concatenated


How do we interpret Elixir code inside of a string using string interpolation?
* Using #{}, We can also interpolate values in strings. Essentially, this means we can evaluate code inside of a string. The code you want to interpolate inside of the string goes between the curly braces {}

    * Besides allowing double-quotes to be escaped with a backslash, strings also support the following escape characters:
    * \0 - Null byte
    * \a - Bell
